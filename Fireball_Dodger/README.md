Created with GPT4.

Requirements:

- pygame (just do pip install pygame)

Place cupcake.png, player.png, fireball.png in the same folder as the Fireball_Dodger.ipynb

Run code and enjoy the game

Total time to create: 40 min

Prompt: I would like to create a Python game. The game's objective is to dodge fireballs coming from all four directions. You control a player that can move up, down, left, right. You have three lives and your aim is to collect cupcakes spawned at a random position. The score is based on the number of cupcakes you collect.

Follow-up Prompt: Now create a health bar and a score bar at the top of the game.

UPDATE (8 DEC):
- Gemini_Comparison.ipynb also compares Gemini's performance to generate this game (TLDR: GPT4 is still better)
