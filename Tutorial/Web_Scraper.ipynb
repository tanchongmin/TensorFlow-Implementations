    "- Created by John Tan Chong Min and last modified on 18 Aug 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "- Uses ChatGPT to do flexible processing\n",
    "- Uses StrictJSON framework (https://github.com/tanchongmin/strictjson) to constrain ChatGPT output to json\n",
    "- Uses Selenium to do web browsing, and Beautiful Soup to do HTML Extraction (does not work for PDF yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps\n",
    "- Finds list of primary sources from google search\n",
    "- Finds list of secondary sources from scraping the \"a href\" tag, and filters them using ChatGPT to `max_url_per_site` urls\n",
    "- Extracts out relevant information according to `output_format` for each site. Splits into chunks of `MAX_TOKENS` with overlap of 100 tokens. Max 4 chunks.\n",
    "- Uses ChatGPT to combine information from the same site\n",
    "- Uses ChatGPT to rank the relevance of the scraped sites\n",
    "- Outputs the scraped sites and their information in order of relevance into an Excel file"
